# Variables
# how programs store values
# also known as name

# when writing variable best practices
# snake_case
# start with lowercase or underscore
# letters numbers or underscore
# Case sensitive
# if starting with underscore then private
# can't overwrite keywords

# BAD
# userIq
# UserIQ

# Good
# user_iq

# iq is variable
# iq is name and we are binding the value 190 to it
user_iq = 190


# later on in program
print(user_iq)


# constants
PI = 3.14
PI = 0

# rapidly assign values to variables
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
